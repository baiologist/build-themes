<p>Tumblr is a blogging platform, owned by Yahoo, which lets bloggers share anything. Tumblr has experienced phenomenal growth since 2007, with over 250 million blogs and over 100 billion posts online. The platform is used by everyone, from large companies to creatives, to create and share.</p>
<p>Tumblr themes are reusable custom HTML documents used by Tumblr blogs to change the way blogs look and perform on the web. Just like blogging on Tumblr, it is easy to quickly start creating themes.</p>
<p>Creating themes with Tumblr <strong>requires</strong> prerequisite knowledge of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/html">HTML</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/css">CSS</a>, so it is important that you are up to scratch with these languages.</p>
<p>This book assumes prior knowledge of HTML and CSS. There is also section which makes use of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript">JavaScript</a> to increase the interactivity of themes. However, JavaScript is not absolutely necessary to create Tumblr themes.</p>
<p>Keep <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes/">Tumblr&rsquo;s theme documentation</a> handy as you work through this book, as there are references to the documentation throughout. The theme documentation provides a complete reference of Tumblr theme development.</p>
<h2>Editing themes</h2>

<p>To make changes to Tumblr theme code, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>user settings</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select your blog from the blog list</li>
<li>Click <strong>edit appearance</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>edit theme</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This opens the customize panel. Once you&rsquo;re in this panel, click on <strong>edit html</strong> to open up the Tumblr code editor.</p>

<p>The editor provided by Tumblr isn&rsquo;t great for editing code, so many developers simply copy and paste their code into Tumblr from a text editor, such as <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>.</p>
